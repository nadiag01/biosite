<p>Anthony has several hobbies that he participates in throughout the week. He really enjoys going to play basketball with his coworkers and friends, typically on Fridays after work to kick start the weekend. They all decide to get together and although it can often get competitive it is all in good spirits. His favorite basketball team is Orlando Magic who he watches religiously during basketball season.
   He also enjoys football where you will often catch him watching his two favorite football teams the Denver Broncos and the Georgia Bulldogs (Go Dogs!). Outside of sports he also enjoys a great tv series which currently is ‘Power Book Three: Raising Kannan’ on Starz and several anime series, specifically many of the classics (Attack on Titan, Bleach, Dragon Ball Z, Tokyo Ghoul, Demon Slayer, etc.)
   On his spare time, he will sometimes do beat production using ‘Fl Studios’ to produce music and share his creations with family and friends. Some of his favorite music artists include Logic, Wiz Khalifa, and Big Krit. </p>
