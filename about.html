<div class="abouttext">
  <p> Anthony is twenty-eight years old and was born and raised in <a href="https://www.visitflorida.org/" target="blank"> Florida</a>, where he still resides. He is the eldest of one brother, who also lives in Florida along with his parents, with whom he keeps in close contact daily.
      Most of his immediate family however is in Louisianna where he often visits for holidays, celebrations and to simply spend quality time with.</p>
 
  <p> He is currently engaged and expecting a baby boy in early 2024. Anthony currently works as an electrical engineer and really enjoys being able to be a part of the creation of military and commercial ships.
      He has always had a passion for learning how to fix things that are broken, or reworking problems to figure out a solution. This is why math is one of his favorite subjects. He has always been extremely ambitious with anything he puts his mind to.</p>

  <p> His favorite foods are chicken wings with buffalo sauce and a nice juicy steak. His favorite colors are red, black, and gold and he is somewhat of a shoe fanatic as well. 
      He is constantly getting new shoes in every color I can think of. He also enjoys traveling and has visited several places within the United States and some places outside of the country (Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Washington D.C, Mobile, Birmingham, Gatlinburg, and Mexico to name a few). He plans to take more trips out of the country in the following year ahead.
      In the meantime, he plans to stay home and enjoy living in the moment.</p>
