<p> When it comes to goals, accomplishments and embellishments Anthony has had his fair share.  Anthony was a part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program during high school. This program is aimed at disciplinary learning that allows the student to receive college credit and prepares students for college level learning.</p> 

<p>While in high school, he was second chair trumpet in the high school concert band (Chair placement is determined by your skill set as a player, the higher your skill set the higher your chair placement).</p> 

<p>Anthony graduated high school in 2014 with a 3.8 GPA. He went on to community college where he finished all his prerequisite requirements then completed his four-year bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU).</p> 

<p>From there he continues to excel in his career. Anthony has recently received two promotions at his current job since only being there for two years and has achieved a supervisor/shift lead position which he is extremely proud of.</p> 

<p>Anthony’s future goals consist of moving out of his hometown with his family, buying a house, and being able to buy his dream car, a Ford Mustang GT. Anthony also plans to buy several other older cars so that he can build them up on his own.</p> 

<p> He is a car enthusiast at heart and loves to tinker at older cars and rebuild them up. Lastly, He loves fitness and likes to stay in shape, he is constantly setting up new records for him to accomplish for himself at the gym.</p>
